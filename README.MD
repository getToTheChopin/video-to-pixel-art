Video-to-Pixel-Art
=====

<p>Turn videos into pixel art! Use your webcam feed or upload a video, then use the controls to adjust the color palette and pixel size.</p>
<p><b>Live demo: https://collidingscopes.github.io/video-to-pixel-art/</b></p>
<img src="assets/ipodAd.gif">
<p>All processing is done in real-time within your browser, using javascript / webgl shaders / html canvas.</p>
<p>You can export your creations as images or videos to save / share your work.</p>
<p>This tool is completely free, open source (MIT license), without any paywalls or premium options. You are welcome to use it for personal or commercial purposes.</p>
<p>If you found this tool useful, feel free to buy me a coffee. This would be much appreciated during late-night coding sessions!</p>

<p>If the video export feature does not work for you, please try a free screen-recording tool such as OBS Studio.</p>
<p>I do not have access to any of the videos that you upload here, as all processing is done "client-side" (i.e., <b>no videos or images are saved/stored by me â€” they stay on your computer only</b>).</p>
